**The Unlikely Friends**

In the heart of Africa, a curious cat named Whiskers stumbled upon a lost zebra foal named Zoe. Despite their differences, they quickly became inseparable friends. One sunny afternoon, as they explored the savannah together, Whiskers asked Zoe to help her solve an integral problem: $$\int \frac{x^2}{(x+1)^3} dx$$

Zoe, being a math whiz in disguise, cleverly recognized the integral as a variant of the standard substitution method and helped Whiskers simplify it. Together, they discovered that the solution was **âˆ« (x-1) / x^2 dx**, which led them to a hidden watering hole, where they quenched their thirst and celebrated their mathematical adventure.
